# PASSWORD LOCKER AND GENERATOR


> This application was created inorder to solve password problems.


As a user, you can create a password locker account with my details, a login username and password.
As a user, you can store my already existing account credentials in the application. Assuming you already have a twitter account, you can store my already existing twitter username and password in the application.
As a user, you can create new account credentials in the application. For example, if you have not yet signed up for Instagram, you would can create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for me to use when you sign up for Instagram.
As a user, you can have the option of putting in a password that you can use for the new credential account. For example, when creating my Instagram credential account, you can have an option of putting in the password you can use instead of having the application generate a password for me.
As a user, you also can view my various account credentials and their passwords in the application.
As a user, you can delete a credentials account that you no longer need in the application.
